## üìù CONCLUSION

The game has an impressive frontend with modern UI and extensive features, but requires significant backend development to be production-ready. The estimated timeline for full production readiness is **8-10 weeks** with a dedicated team.

**Recommendation**: Focus on MVP features first (core game, authentication, leaderboard, basic monetization) to launch in 4-6 weeks, then add advanced features post-launch.
